# About
I composing this paragraph in a heart of snowy tale. Four wooden walls guard me from long-awaited and beloved cold and burning snow. This walls and home itself were built by my father, we call it «Дача» (Dacha) — tiny building for short live near the forest.

It's 1st January here. Light wind of miracle still in the air. Even thoughts — invisible but always so powerful and severe — become sparky fresh snow. I need my own «Dacha». My little programmer's dacha. So here she is.
